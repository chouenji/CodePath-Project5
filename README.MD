# Web Development Project 5 - _BreweryFinder_

Submitted by: **Kevin do Canto**

This web app: **BreweryFinder is an app that helps you discover new breweries and beer-related experiences in your area. Using BreweryFinder, you can search for breweries by location, filter by brewery type, and explore details about each brewery, such as its website URL, phone number, and address. Additionally, BreweryFinder provides a "Random Brewery" feature that selects a brewery for you to try. With BreweryFinder, you can expand your knowledge of local beer culture and find new favorite spots to enjoy a pint with friends.**
